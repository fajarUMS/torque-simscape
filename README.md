Torque Combiner Using Simscape
==============================

Torque combiners play a pivotal role in mechanical systems where multiple torque sources act in concert to drive a common load, such as in hybrid vehicles and multi-motor industrial equipment. This study proposes a simulation framework using Simscape, incorporating a distributed rotational mass-spring-damper shaft model that permits real-time inclusion of variable torque sources, inertial loads, and disturbances.
